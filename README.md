## Description

FuelPHP is a fast, lightweight PHP 5.3 framework. In an age where frameworks are a dime a dozen, We believe that FuelPHP will stand out in the crowd.  It will do this by combining all the things you love about the great frameworks out there, while getting rid of the bad.

## This repository

The repository contains the FuelPHP framework documentation.

The pages are created using the [Markdown](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) format, and stored in the /docs folder. The folder and
file structure refects the order in which the pages will appear in the index. For this purpose, both pages and folders are prefixed with an order
number, to the sequence can be controlled. If sequence is not imported, you can use any name you want.

For easy usage, a one-script website has been included, which allows you to install the documentation locally, and access it via your development
webserver, or even the built-in webserver of PHP 5.4. If you don't have this available, you can view the individual files only via github, via
the FuelPHP website using the links above, or even with any text viewer, as Markdown is a very readable format.

If you want to participate, create a fork of this repository, make your changes, and send us a pull request!
